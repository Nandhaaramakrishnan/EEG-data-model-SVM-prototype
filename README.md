# EEG-data-model-SVM-prototype

This is a very basic SVM leisure time model(classifier for annotaions) built for the analysis of EEG signals.

The edf files were converted into csv files to reduce computational difficulties. A limited amount of data was taken based on my personal machine requirements. The final .csv files are added in a folder with this repository.
